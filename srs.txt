# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## Project Name

**MEIP – Meta‑Insyt Email Intelligence Platform**

## Version

v1.0 (Internal Enterprise Tool)

## Purpose

MEIP is an **internal, enterprise‑grade email validation and lead intelligence system** built for Meta‑Insyt. Its purpose is to **maximize deliverability, reduce bounce rates, and prevent good leads from being incorrectly discarded** by using layered, explainable, and tunable validation logic.

This system is **not a public SaaS** and will be used only by authorized Meta‑Insyt personnel.

## Goals & Non‑Goals

### Goals

* Achieve **~9/10 practical accuracy** (not theoretical perfection)
* Avoid false negatives (good emails marked bad)
* Provide **clear reasons** for every decision
* Handle **large volumes (up to 1M emails)** via async processing
* Enable **manual + CSV validation**
* Separate leads by confidence tiers
* Export clean, actionable results

### Non‑Goals

* Not claiming 100% SMTP‑level certainty (impossible)
* No paid APIs required
* No public access / no external exposure

---

## User Roles

### 1. Admin

* Manage SMTP sender pool
* Manage disposable domain list
* Configure thresholds (RTPC scores)
* View system analytics

### 2. Operator (Default User)

* Upload CSV files
* Manually test emails
* View results
* Export filtered leads

---

## System Architecture

### Backend

* **Django 5.x**
* Django REST Framework (internal APIs)
* PostgreSQL (recommended)
* Redis + Celery (async jobs)

### Frontend

* Django Templates or React (optional)
* **Uber‑dark / modern dark UI**
* TailwindCSS or ShadCN‑style components

### Execution Modes

* Sync (manual check)
* Async batch processing (CSV / bulk)

---

## Core Features

## 1. Email Input Methods

### 1.1 Manual Entry Screen

* Textarea (comma / newline separated emails)
* Real‑time validation feedback
* Single‑email deep inspection

### 1.2 CSV Upload Screen

* Required column: `Email`
* Optional columns preserved
* File size support: large (streaming upload)

---

## 2. Layered Validation Engine (Critical)

### Validation Layers (in order)

1. **Syntax Validation**

   * RFC‑compliant syntax check
   * Unicode normalization

2. **Domain Resolution**

   * MX record lookup
   * A record fallback

3. **Disposable Domain Detection**

   * Internal maintained list (editable via UI)
   * Zero tolerance (hard fail)

4. **Role‑Based Address Detection**

   * admin, support, sales, info, contact, help, customercare, etc.
   * Soft penalty (never hard fail alone)

5. **Domain Age Intelligence**

   * WHOIS lookup
   * Age recorded but **not a hard blocker**
   * Used only in scoring

6. **Provider Detection**

   * Google Workspace
   * Microsoft 365
   * Zoho
   * Custom MX

7. **Catch‑All Heuristic**

   * Based on provider + MX behavior
   * Flagged as "Possible" only

8. **DMARC / SPF Presence**

   * Detects enterprise domains
   * Used for confidence boosting

9. **SMTP Micro‑Check (RTPC‑style)**

   * HELO + MAIL FROM + RCPT TO
   * No DATA sent
   * Uses internal SMTP sender pool
   * Timeout‑safe

10. **Bounce History (Optional)**

    * Previous failed emails penalized
    * Never hard‑blocked alone

---

## 3. RTPC Scoring System

### RTPC = Real‑Time Probabilistic Confidence

Score Range: **0 – 100**

| Condition         | Effect |
| ----------------- | ------ |
| Valid SMTP        | +      |
| Disposable        | −50    |
| Role‑Based        | −30    |
| SMTP Fail         | −50    |
| Bounce History    | −40    |
| DMARC/SPF Present | +10    |

### Confidence Buckets

| RTPC Score | Status          | Action              |
| ---------- | --------------- | ------------------- |
| 81–100     | Deliverable     | SEND                |
| 51–80      | Risky           | Verify / test batch |
| 0–50       | Not Deliverable | DO NOT SEND         |

*(Admin can tune thresholds)*

---

## 4. Result Classification

Leads are separated into:

* Deliverable
* Risky (small test batch recommended)
* Not Deliverable

Each email **must include reasons** — no black‑box decisions.

---

## 5. Dashboard Screens

### 5.1 Upload Screen

* CSV upload
* Progress bar (async jobs)

### 5.2 Manual Checker Screen

* Single email deep diagnostics
* Full reason breakdown

### 5.3 Results Dashboard

* Filters by status
* Search
* Provider breakdown
* RTPC histogram

### 5.4 Export Screen

* Export All
* Export Deliverable Only
* Export Risky Only

Formats:

* CSV
* XLSX

---

## 6. CSV Format (Output)

### Mandatory Columns

* Email
* Status
* RTPC Score
* Recommendation

### Diagnostic Columns

* Syntax Valid
* Domain Valid
* Disposable
* Role‑Based
* Catch‑All Likely
* Domain Age (Days)
* Provider
* SMTP Micro‑Check
* DMARC/SPF Present
* Bounce History Flag
* Reason

---

## 7. Performance Requirements

* Multithreaded + async execution
* Celery workers for large batches
* Cache DNS / WHOIS results
* Cap SMTP checks per domain

Target:

* 1M emails batch (chunked)
* No blocking UI

---

## 8. Security & Access Control

* Login required
* Role‑based access
* No public endpoints
* Optional IP allowlist / Warp access

---

## 9. Deployment

### Local / Internal

* Dockerized Django app
* Redis + PostgreSQL

### Optional

* Warp‑protected access
* Internal VPN

---

## 10. Future Enhancements (Optional)

* Campaign warm‑up analytics
* ISP reputation hints
* Lead scoring integration
* CRM sync
* Adaptive scoring via feedback loop

---

## Final Note (Important)

This system is **not trying to be perfect** — it is trying to be **trustworthy, explainable, and safe for revenue**.

MEIP prioritizes:

> “Never kill a good lead blindly.”

That is what makes it better than generic SaaS validators.
